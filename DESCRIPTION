Description: Maury can be used to quantify relatedness of
    multiple samples by using Next Generation Sequencing data.
    This is done by looking at allele-frequency at sites of
    common polymorphisms. Maury can be used in a multitude
    of applications, for example detecting tumor/normal
    sample-swaps.
